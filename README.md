Base project with React, Webpack 4, SASS and Bootstrap
======================================================

Very opinionated, probably a lot can be done a lot better. 
This is however one of my first React base projects and it feels useful enough to reuse.

Some commands to install and use
````bash
yarn install
yarn run dev    # run development server with live reload
yarn run build  # pack for production usage
````
